scratchpad for the development of iemnet
========================================

speed & syslocks
================
setting Pd's clocks is not thread-safe, but calling sys_lock() will slow
the entire process down to unusability.
therefore, we use a (per-receiver) thread, that get's waits on a pthread_cond_t
and will syslock if needed.
LATER there should only be one of these clock-threads (per RTE, in case we
finally can run multiple Pd's in a single applications), that maintains it's own
list of callbacks+data.

tests for tcpclient/server:
	client disconnects -> server should get notified
	server disconnects -> client should get notified
	client crashes -> server should disconnect
	server crashes -> client should disconnect

known BUGS:

[tcpclient] now does all the actual connect/disconnect work in a helper-thread.
unfortunately, iemnet__receiver_destroy() assumes that it is called from the
main-thread and will outlet_list the remaining bytes in the dtor.
however, outlet_list is not threadsafe.
possible solution: see speed&syslocks for a leightweight thread-safe callback
framework.
